### Under Development

**Kalisio is under heavy development, updates will be pushed frequently.
As a consequence it should be considered unstable, not yet ready for production use.
Although we try to avoid this wherever possible, `0.x` versions on the master branch can promote breaking changes in the API.**

### Documentation

The [kDocs](https://kaelia-tech.gitbooks.io/kaelia/) are loaded with awesome stuff and tell you everything you need to know about using and configuring Kalisio.

Take also a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/kalisio/projects/1).
