# API

The externally exposed API of the internal Kano components (2D map and 3D globe) comes from the one provided by the KDK:
* [common mixins](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/map/mixins.html#mixins)
* [2D map mixins](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/map/mixins.html#map)
* [3D globe mixins](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/map/mixins.html#globe)

Similarly, most of the internal mapping components come from the [KDK](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/map/components.html).
